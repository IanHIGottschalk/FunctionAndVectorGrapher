# Function & Vector Grapher

A Java Swing application that lets you graph mathematical functions and vectors using a custom on-screen math keyboard.

## Features
- Graph any function of `x` (e.g. `x^2 + sin(x)`)
- Draw vectors from origin or any point (e.g. `3,2` or `3,2;1,1`)
- Custom math keyboard for safe input
- Clean, modular code with coordinate translation helpers

## How to Run
1. Compile both `Main.java` and `GraphPanel.java`
2. Run `Main.java`
